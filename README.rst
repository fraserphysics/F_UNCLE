Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) Release Information
---------------------------------------------------------

The initial version of this code was written at LANL.  It was released
in 2016 with Los Alamos Computer Code index LA-CC-16-034 and the
following description:

The F_UNCLE project is for quantitatively characterizing uncertainty
about functions and how physical laws and experiments constrain that
uncertainty.  The project is an evolving platform consisting of
program and text files that numerically demonstrate and explore
quantitative characterizations of uncertainty about functions and how
either historical or proposed experiments have or could constrain that
uncertainty.  No actual physical measurements are distributed as part
of the software.

Documentation
-------------

Documentation is available on `readthedocs
<http://f-uncle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_

Scipy 2016
----------

The figures from scipy 2016 paper can be generated by the
`scipy2016.py` script located in `F_UNCLE/examples`. From within the
`examples` directory, run the following command:

    $ python scipy2016.py

to generate all the figures

Testing
-------

From the root directory of `F_UNCLE` run:

   $ nosetests -all-modules
